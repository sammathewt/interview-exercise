# OpenMoney Interview Exercise

## Pre-requisites

- .NET 5 SDK installed on your machine
- A .NET IDE of your choice

## Introduction

A developer on your team, Baldrick, has just quit with no notice period. And good riddance because he was overpaid and made a mess of the codebase...Unfortunately this means you have to pick up the ticket he was working on before he left. As expected, he's done a bad job. The code is a mess, there are bugs to fix, and it's missing an important feature.

The feature you're looking at is a Mortgage and Home Insurance quote provider service. The actual quotes themselves are coming back from third party integrations, the interfaces for the third parties have been provided by our partners so we can't change these.

Below are a few tasks to get through so we can ship the new feature! Also as Baldrick was a complete incompetent, the code he's written is ugly and reads like The Daily Star, not the well written prose we expect. While working through the following tasks please tidy up the code as you go.

## Summary

- Fork & clone our repository [instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
- Work through the below tasks
- Tidy up the code as you go
- If you can't finish a task don't panic, just move on
- Submit a PR for us to review [instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

## Tasks

### Task 1 - Bug

QA have reported that some strange negative monthly payment values have been coming back from the mortgage provider. All the unit tests are passing but maybe the unit tests are as useless as some of the production code. See if you can figure out what the issue is.

### Task 2 - Performance

QA have also noticed that it seems to be taking longer than expected. As the 3rd party integrations are HTTP based, we can't do anything about how long the requests take to complete, but can you identify anything within the existing code that might improve this area?

### Task 3 - Missing tests

As usual, Baldrick made a token effort to write some unit tests but has made some glaring omissions. Try and identify some areas that are missing test coverage and add them in.

### Task 4 - Error handling

Our customers hate unhandled exceptions, as should you, so make our new feature handle errors gracefully. It would be nice if we could let our consumers know which quote failed, and still return quotes that succeeded when another has failed.

### Bonus Task

The `MortgageClient` and `HomeInsuranceClient` classes share quite a few similarities, is there anything you could do to reduce some duplication between these 2 classes?
